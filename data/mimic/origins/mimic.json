  "description": "The Mimic, one of the spirits that appears alongside the demon. It's a bone-white Humanoid Abomination with bulging eyes and disgustingly black teeth contorted into a Slasher Smile. It torments Rebecca throughout her night at the mortuary, has a tendency to appear in places the player wasn't previously looking at, and can even appear within seemingly impossible spaces like the inside of a cabinet. It's the page image here for a very good reason"
